-> Auxiliary space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm

-> Space Complexity of an algorithm is total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size.

-> Space complexiy includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input.

-> If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space. If we create a two-dimensional array of size n * n, this will require O(n * 2) space
